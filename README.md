# SuperPrice
Hackathon project done in 24h at Calhacks 5.0, UC Berkeley. 
Using Microsoft Azure to identify product in image. With database entry of expiration date, stock left and simulated demand, we calculated a dynamic price and plotted it on an arduino display. 
Idea behind: Use dynamic pricing to sell products that expire soon (brown bananas for example) and reduce food waste in supermarkets.
